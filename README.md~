# Libft

This is the first project at 42 school. The goal is to code our own function library, so that we can use it in our future projects.

## How to use

Clone the repository and compile the library:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FloraCornillon/Libft42.git
cd Libft42
make

You can use it with your main.c:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c libft.a

## Skill practice

Understanding of memory management in C

Function implementation based on official manual pages (man)

Use of a Makefile
