# Libft42

This is the first project at 42 school. The goal is to code our own function library, so that we can use it in our future projects.

You can find the project subject [here](./fr.subject.pdf).

## How to Use

Clone the repository and compile the library:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FloraCornillon/Libft42.git
cd Libft42
make
```

You can use it with your `main.c`:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c libft.a
```

## Skill Practice

- Understanding of memory management in C  
- Function implementation based on official manual pages (`man`)  
- Use of a Makefile
